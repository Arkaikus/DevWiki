# Move Windows Docker Data Folder

Windows installation of docker works differently to linux, with the latest update and taking advantage
of windows wsl2 background the virtualization is easier and seamless with other installed linux distros,
this means we can call docker from within the wsl2 distro of our choice referencing to the already installed windows 
wsl2 version of docker that works also from windows cmd. this is amazing!

One thing we might run into is the lack of space, using a lot of different images takes a lot of space, then maybe 
we could just plug into another drive but how do we change where to save those images?

According to this issue [comment](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/185#issuecomment-640521418) all we have 
to do is migrate the virtual data partition of docker with this

`wsl --export docker-desktop-data docker-desktop-data.tar`

`wsl --unregister docker-desktop-data`

`wsl --import docker-desktop-data X:\path\to\data\ docker-desktop-data.tar --version 2`

these windows commands allows you to backup your images and then mount another virtual disk in a different location in X drive
